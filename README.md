# Customer Support Chat Intent Classification

> Building intent classification models using bank users' chat scripts






## Description

A chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the Internet, and they provide several benefits including:

- 24/7 availability
- Improved efficiency and speed of response
- Cost-effectiveness compared to human customer service
- Ability to handle multiple conversations simultaneously
- Personalization of interactions
- Ability to handle routine tasks freeing up human agents for more complex issues.

So chatbots are becoming an increasingly important tool for businesses looking to improve their customer service, increase efficiency, and provide personalized interactions with their customers.

Intent classification is an important component of chatbot technology, as it enables the chatbot to understand the user's request and respond appropriately. In a chatbot conversation, the user inputs a message and the intent classification algorithm processes the message to determine the user's intention or "intent". The algorithm then matches the user's intent to a pre-defined category or "intent" in the chatbot's database, allowing the chatbot to respond with the relevant information.

For example, if a user inputs "What are the store hours?" the intent classification algorithm would categorize this as a "store hours" intent, allowing the chatbot to provide the relevant information in response.

The relationship between chatbots and intent classification is symbiotic, as the accuracy of the chatbot's response depends on the accuracy of the intent classification algorithm. The intent classification algorithm must be trained using a large dataset of user inputs to accurately categorize new user inputs.


The goal of this project is to help banks develop their chatbot system, so they can better assist their customers much more efficiently. Intent classification techniques are used for this project along with banking data.
